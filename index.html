      <h2>Today's Topic: Online Gaming</h2>

      <p>Since the dawn of mankind, we have always wanted to belong. Playing video games online is finding that group, and telling each other things that you would not tell someone else in real life.</p>
      <h3>A Little Game Called Destiny 2</h3>
      <p>Today, I will talk about a game called Destiny 2. The studio that developed the game, Bungie, decided to change their mantra from "We create games we want to play" to "We create worlds that inspire friendship." This is because they themselves don't like playing the game, but they wish you the best in the endeavor of creating a single friend through this game.</p>
      <p>I will now explain how Bungie's game philosophy counteracts that mantra. In most endgame scenarios, where players spend most of their time, if a single person dies, it creates hostility towards that player. Not only does the game limit revives to one per player, they also have achievements with sought after rewards for completing various activites with no one dying. In addition, dying in the game will waste time, as players must wait before being able to be revived. This creates friction between players, and thus getting in the way of connecting with others in a positive light.</p>
      <p>In another example, during raids, players are commonly randomly assigned a mechanic that must be resolved properly, or the team will have to start the encounter again. Newer players who may not recognize a mechanic is happening, will commonly fall victim to these, which will create friction between the veteran players and the newcomers.</p>
      <p>In addition to the above, there are other systematic issues. Builds, which are necessary for many activities, commonly revolve around "Exotic" armor, which is a piece of gear that is supposed to modify how you play the game. In the past, these were just random drops, and you could just get them by playing the game however you chose. Now, however, new pieces of exotic armor are locked behind a specific activity called "Legendary Lost Sectors" which are short activities which need to be done solo in order for there to be a chance of players receiving the new exotics. By requiring players to require solo play to participate in endgame, they are punishing players that like to take a more supported role, or even just prefer to play with their friends.</p>
      <h3>The Other Side of the Story</h3>
      <p>In their defense, however, Bungie has made strides in this department. You can now acquire new exotic gear from certain events in game, such as the Vex Offensive, which can be done with up to nine different players. The other thing, is that sometimes, people want to be able to do some content on their own. This is where having solo content like Legendary Lost Sectors makes sense. However, I do not think that should come at the cost of those who wish to do content with others. Online games today try to appeal to both those who want to play with others, and those who want to play by themselves. While this doesn't seem to come directly at the cost of those who want to play with others, it does make one question how online multiplayer games should be designed.</p>
